snippet: A simple site for calculating the probabilities associated with rolling multiple dice
index: 3
---

I couldn't find an easy-to-use or attractive website for calculating the probabilities of the rolls of multiple dice in
RPG Games (such as Dungeons&Dragons). So I built this site in an afternoon as a simple way to visualize it. It's
bare bones but easy to understand and use.

I walk through collecting all the data needed with nice big buttons on the form, then run the calculation and generate a
graph of all the possibilities. You can even print out the graph, and it looks nice, not like a printed website!
