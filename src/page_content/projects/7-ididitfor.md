I Did It forâ€¦ uses the Django python framework to create an useful application
for tracking the time you've spent working toward a project or goal or something 
you are learning. I went with a bright bold design that represents an 
interesting contrast to many of my other projects.

As usual, it has optional passkey authentication so you can log in instantly 
with the biometrics already present on your device. In addition to full CRUD
functionality, it has Django's excellent administration backend for even
finer control of what is present in the database.

By using htmx, I was able to create an experience that has the responsiveness
of a single-page app, with the simplicity of a server-rendered application.
