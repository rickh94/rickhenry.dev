snippet: App for managing inventory of musical instruments
index: 0

I built this app to manage the location and information of many musical
instruments given out to students at various locations. It's mobile-first
and very feature-rich. Its functionality goes beyond what most people need,
but shows how an application can be customized to an exact workflow.
